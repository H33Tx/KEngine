# What is the KEngine?
The KEngine is a PHP framework made for primarily our projects.
It is intended to run all of our projects as "themes" instead
of completely new frameworks for each of our project. As we are
familiar with it, development will go much smoother and faster
with it than before.

# Requirements
PHP 5.3 to 7.4, 8.x is not supported.

# Installation
You need to install required node_modules. Do so with `npm install`
or download `node_modules.zip` in the "releases"-tab.

For development, run `npx tailwindcss -o ./dist/output.css --watch`
and force refresh page when making changes to the templates.

# Documentation
For installation, see the paragraph above.
